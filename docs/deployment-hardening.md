Summary of deployment fix and hardening

What I changed

- Avoid server-only modules being bundled into browser builds by lazily importing server modules in `lib/sync-store/src/index.ts`.
  - Previously `@workspace/db` and `@workspace/db/client` were imported at module scope; those imports can pull `drizzle-orm` and `pg` into browser bundles and cause Vercel build failures.
  - The new implementation uses `import()` and runtime guards so bundlers won't include server-only code in client bundles.

Why this prevents future Vercel build failures

- Dynamic imports prevent static bundlers (Vite/Rollup) from resolving server-only modules into client bundles.
- The repo already includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs `pnpm run typecheck:deploy` and `pnpm run build:deploy` on PRs and pushes to `main`, preventing regressions from merging.

SPA routing on Vercel (refresh / deep links)

- TrustKeyper is a client-side SPA (Wouter). Direct visits or refreshes on `/owner/dashboard` must serve `index.html`, then the app router handles the path.
- `vercel.json` rewrites all non-`/api` paths to `/index.html`. Without this, Vercel returns its platform `404: NOT_FOUND` page.
- Build output must be `artifacts/trustkeyper/dist/public` (see root `vercel.json`). If the Vercel project **Root Directory** is set to `artifacts/trustkeyper`, set **Output Directory** to `dist/public` in the dashboard and keep `artifacts/trustkeyper/vercel.json` rewrites.

Recommended follow-ups

- When adding new workspace packages, keep server-only code behind dynamic imports or conditional `exports` in `package.json`.
- Consider adding an automated check that scans for direct `drizzle-orm` / `pg` imports outside `lib/db` (we already have `scripts/check-drizzle-singleton.mjs` doing this).
- Optionally configure Vercel to run the same `buildCommand` as CI (already mirrored by `build:deploy`).

If you want, I can commit these changes and open a PR with the fix and the documentation, or I can proceed to add an automated lint rule to catch server-only imports in client packages.
